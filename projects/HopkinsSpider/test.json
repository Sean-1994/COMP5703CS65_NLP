Incontinence can affect both men and women in any age group but is more common in women and the elderly. As the population ages, the number of people suffering from bladder control problems is increasing. The costs of this problem are personal, physical and financial, and many with incontinence suffer social embarrassment, isolation, ill health and even depression.", "p1": "Normal urinary continence and bladder control requires a complex interaction between the brain, nervous system and organs in the pelvis. The pelvic organs include the bladder, urethra, the prostate in men and the muscles of the pelvic floor called the levator ani. Controlling the outflow of urine are two valves, or sphincters, located in the bladder neck and earliest portion of the urethra. The bladder neck sphincter is under involuntary (autonomic) control while the urethral sphincter has both voluntary and involuntary components. The levator ani muscles act as a supporting hammock for this system and also have reflex as well as voluntary activity.", "p2": "The bladder has two essential functions: to store urine and to empty urine. While this concept is simple, the interplay necessary between the brain, bladder, sphincters and pelvic floor muscles is very complex. Perceptions of bladder filling and fullness, and subsequent initiation of emptying requires synchronization of the nervous system, the bladder muscle, sphincters and pelvic floor. Similarly, controlling a full bladder in the face of daily activity relies on precise neural orchestration and healthy pelvic organs.", "p3": "When any component of the system loses normal function, urinary control can be affected. Neural injury, damage to the bladder, sphincters, supporting structures and even the pelvic floor can all lead to incontinence. It is important to understand that treatment is available. Incontinence is not something to accept as a result of age, surgery, childbirth or related illness. Our understanding of the mechanisms of urine leakage and therapies to restore control continue to progress. The first step toward treatment, however, is recognition of the problem. Incontinence is a burden that can be lifted."}}}

The virus is passed on most often during sexual activity. It can also be passed on by sharing needles used to inject IV drugs. HIV can be passed to your baby during pregnancy, labor, delivery, and through breastfeeding. If you know early in your pregnancy that you are HIV positive, you can get treatment that greatly lowers your chance of passing on the virus to your child, the CDC says.", "p2": "HPV is a common sexually transmitted disease. Some types of HPV can cause genital warts (condylomas). These can happen on the inside or outside areas of the genitals. They may spread to the surrounding skin or to a sexual partner. Many other types of HPV cause no symptoms, so you may not know that you are infected. In most cases, the virus goes away and does not cause further health problems. But if the virus lasts, normal cells can change and become abnormal. Women with an HPV infection with high-risk types like HPV 16 and 18 have an increased risk of getting cervical cancer. Pap tests can detect HPV infection, as well as abnormal cervical cells. An HPV vaccine protects against the types of HPV that cause most cervical cancers. It also protects against most genital warts in both men and women, and against anal cancer in men. Even with treatment for genital warts, the virus remains in the body and warts can reappear. Certain types of HPV can also cause warts on other body parts such as the hands. These are called common warts. These don't generally cause health problems. If a pregnant woman has a large number of genital warts, the growths can complicate a vaginal delivery. If the warts block the birth canal, the woman may need a cesarean section.", "p3": "Chlamydia is the most commonly reported STD in the U.S. It can affect both men and women. This infection may cause an abnormal genital discharge and burning with urination. In women, untreated chlamydia may lead to pelvic inflammatory disease (PID).

In addition to PID, these include tubal (ectopic) pregnancy and infertility. Chlamydia can also be carried in and affect the rectum.

There is no cure for HSV, but medicine can shorten an outbreak and reduce symptoms. HSV can be passed on from the mouth to the genitals during oral sex. The virus can be passed on to sexual partners even if the person has no visible blisters. This is called asymptomatic shedding. HSV can also be spread to a baby at the time of childbirth. This causes a very severe infection in the infant.", "p6": "The first symptom of syphilis is a painless open sore that usually shows up on the penis, in the vagina, or on the skin around either sexual organ.

If a pregnant woman has untreated syphilis, the disease can cause dangerous, even fatal, problems for the baby. The way congenital syphilis affects the infant depends on how long the woman has had the disease and if or when she was treated for the infection. This form of syphilis can cause miscarriage, stillbirth, or death of the baby shortly after birth.

This curvature gives the appearance that the person is leaning to one side.", "p1": "Scoliosis is determined when the curvature of the spine measures 10 degrees or greater on an X-ray. Spinal curvature from scoliosis may occur on the right or left side of the spine, or on both sides in different sections. Both the thoracic (mid) and lumbar (lower) spine may be affected by scoliosis. Scoliosis is a type of spinal deformity.", "p2": "In more than 80 percent of cases, the cause of scoliosis is unknown — a condition called idiopathic scoliosis. In other cases, scoliosis may develop as a result of degeneration of the spinal discs, as seen with arthritis, osteoporosis or as a hereditary condition that tends to run in families."}, "What are the different types of scoliosis?": {"p0": "In congenital scoliosis, spinal curvature develops because of misshapen vertebrae. The diagnosis of congenital scoliosis may be made in early infancy if outward signs are present, but many cases are diagnosed later in childhood.", "p1": "As a child grows, scoliosis may worsen, and asymmetries in the body may develop. Typically, congenital scoliosis is treated with a “watch and wait” approach. Surgery is considered only if a curve is clearly getting worse and the child is facing ongoing deformity and risk of future pain.", "p2": "Doctors, nurses and scientists have been studying the natural history and genetics of scoliosis for decades, but to this day, the cause of idiopathic scoliosis is still unknown. But we do know that the most common time for idiopathic scoliosis to develop is at the onset of adolescence, or around the age of 10.

A straight spine requires normal muscle balance and strength in the torso. In conditions such as cerebral palsy, spina bifida and muscular dystrophy, the muscles are often weak and unbalanced, leading to the development of a spinal curvature.", "p5": "A child with neuromuscular scoliosis is given the option of wearing a scoliosis brace that may slow or prevent the worsening of the condition. Surgical intervention is offered when the curve has reached the tipping point of 50 degrees. Over time, these curves will continue to worsen, leading to progressive imbalance of the torso.

CT scans are more detailed than general X-rays."}, "How is scoliosis treated?": {"p0": "The goal of treatment is to stop the progression of the curve and prevent deformity. Observation and repeated examinations — also referred to as the “watch and wait” approach — may be necessary to determine if the spine is continuing to curve. These are used when a person has a curve that is less than 20 degrees and who is still growing.", "p1": "For actively growing children with scoliosis curves between 20 and 50 degrees, bracing is recommended. An external torso brace, or TLSO, is worn for a prescribed number of hours. The brace applies corrective pressure to the growing spine, preventing further worsening of the scoliosis.

Most kidney stones form on the interior surface of the kidney, where urine leaves the kidney tissue and enters the urinary collecting system. Kidney stones can be small, like a tiny pebble or grain of sand, but are often much larger.", "p1": "The job of the kidneys is to maintain the body's balance of water, minerals and salts. Urine is the product of this filtering process. Under certain conditions, substances normally dissolved in urine, such as calcium, oxalate and phosphate, become too concentrated and can separate out as crystals. A kidney stone develops when these crystals attach to one another, accumulating into a small mass, or stone.", "p2": "Kidney stones come in a variety of mineral types:", "b0": "Calcium stones: Most kidney stones are composed of calcium and oxalate. Many people who form calcium containing stones have too much calcium in their urine, a condition known as hypercalciuria There are several reasons why hypercalciuria may occur. Some people absorb too much calcium from their intestines. Others absorb too much calcium from their bones. Still others have kidneys that do not correctly regulate the amount of calcium they release into their urine. There are some people who form calcium oxalate stones as a result of too much oxalate in the urine, a condition known as hypercalciuria In some cases, too much oxalate in the urine is a result of inflammatory bowel disease, such as Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis, or other times it may be a consequence of prior intestinal surgery. Calcium phosphate stones, another kind of calcium stone, are much less common than calcium oxalate stones. For some people, calcium phosphate stones form as a result of a medical condition known as renal tubular acidosis.", "b1": "Struvite stones: Some patients form stones that are composed of a mixture of magnesium, ammonium, phosphate and calcium carbonate, which is known as struvite. These stones form as a result of infection with certain types of bacteria that can produce ammonia. Ammonia acts to raise the pH of urine, which makes it alkaline and promotes the formation of struvite.", "b2": "Uric acid stones: Uric acid is produced when the body metabolizes protein. When the pH of urine drops below 5.5, urine becomes saturated with uric acid crystals, a condition known as hypercalciuria. When there is too much uric acid in the urine, stones can form. Uric acid stones are more common in people who consume large amounts of protein, such as that found in red meat or poultry. People with gout can also form uric acid stones.", "b3": "Cystine stones: Cystine stones are rare, and they form only in persons with an inherited metabolic disorder that causes high levels of cystine in the urine, a condition known as cystinuria."}, "How are kidney stones diagnosed?": {"p0": "Most people are diagnosed with kidney stones after the thunderclap onset of excruciating and unforgettable pain. This severe pain occurs when the kidney stone breaks loose from the place that it formed, the renal papilla, and falls into the urinary collecting system. When this happens, the stone can block the drainage of urine from the kidney, a condition known as renal colic. The pain may begin in the lower back and may move to the side or the groin. Other symptoms may include blood in the urine (hematuria), frequent or persistent urinary tract infections, urinary urgency or frequency and nausea or vomiting.", "p1": "When your doctor evaluates you for a kidney stone, the first step will be a complete history and physical examination. Important information regarding current symptoms, previous stone events, medical illnesses and conditions, medications, dietary history and family history will all be collected. A physical examination will be performed to evaluate for signs of a kidney stone, such as pain in the flank, lower abdomen or groin.", "p2": "Your doctor will perform a urinalysis, to look for blood or infection in the urine. A blood sample will also be collected so that kidney function and blood counts can be measured.", "p3": "Even though all of these tests are necessary, a kidney stone can only be definitively diagnosed by a radiologic evaluation. In some cases, a simple X-ray, called a KUB , will be adequate to detect a stone. If your doctor requires more information, an intravenous pyelogram (IVP) or a computed tomography (CT) scan may be necessary.", "p4": "Sometimes kidney stones do not cause any symptoms at all. Such painless stones can be discovered when your doctor is looking for other things on X-rays. Sometimes, although a stone does not cause any pain, it can cause other problems, such as recurring urinary tract infections or blood in the urine."}, "How can kidney stones be prevented?": {"p0": "If you have had one kidney stone, you are likely to form another. To reduce your chances of forming another stone, the first step is to determine why your original stone formed in the first place. At the Brady Urological Institute, we believe in the adage, “An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure,” so we place great emphasis on a thorough metabolic evaluation, so that therapies can be appropriately directed towards reducing the risk of recurrent stone disease.", "p1": "If you passed your stone on your own and still have it, your doctor will send it to a laboratory to be analyzed to see what it is made of. Usually, if your stone is removed by ureteroscopy or PERC , your doctor will send a piece of the stone for analysis too. The composition of a stone is an important piece of information to have, as treatment is specific to the type of stone.", "p2": "Because we know that kidney stones form when the urine has too high a concentration of crystals and/or not enough substances that protect against the crystals, a detailed analysis of the metabolism of a stone former is important. Typically, the metabolic evaluation of a stone former consists of a simple blood test and two 24-hour urine collections.", "p3": "The results of these metabolic studies will provide an assessment of the risk of future stone formation. One or more of the following diagnoses and treatments may be made based on these metabolic data.", "p4": "Treatment:", "p5": "The most basic thing you can do to prevent stone formation is to drink more fluids, thereby diluting your urine. Your goal should be to urinate more than two liters per day.", "p6": "All fluids count toward this goal, but water is, of course, the best.", "p7": "Possible treatments:", "p8": "These drugs help to decrease urine calcium excretion. They also help to keep calcium in the bones, reducing the risk for osteoporosis. The most common side effect of thiazide diuretics is potassium loss, so in many cases your doctor will prescribe a potassium supplement to go along with the thiazide diuretic.", "p9": "The human body carefully regulates its sodium levels. When excess sodium is excreted in the urine, calcium is also excreted proportionally. In other words, the more sodium you consume, the more calcium that will be in your urine. Your goal should be to reduce your sodium intake so that you consume less than 2 grams of sodium per day. Watch out for “silent sources” of salt, such as fast foods, packaged or canned foods, softened water and sports drinks.", "p10": "People who form stones sometimes think that because there is too much calcium in their urine, they should restrict their calcium intake. There is no research that supports this practice. Your body needs dietary calcium to support the skeleton. You should be encouraged to consume two servings of dairy (between 800 mg and 1,200 mg per day) or other calcium-rich foods to maintain bone stores of calcium.", "p11": "For patients who form calcium oxalate stones, it is doubly important to consume adequate dietary calcium, because under normal circumstances calcium and oxalate bind together in the intestine and are eliminated from the body. If there is no calcium to join with oxalate, the oxalate will be reabsorbed by your body and passed into the urine where it may increase the risk of calcium oxalate stones.", "p12": "No matter what your diagnosis, you should drink enough water to produce at least 2 liters of urine per day.", "p13": "Possible treatments:", "p14": "Citrate is a molecule that binds to calcium in the urine, preventing calcium from binding to oxalate or phosphate and forming a stone. If your potassium level is low or normal, your doctor may prescribe potassium citrate supplement. If you have high blood potassium levels, your doctor may prescribe a sodium citrate supplement, such as Bicitra or sodium bicarbonate.", "p15": "There is some evidence that citrus juices, such as orange juice or lemonade, may increase urinary citrate levels, so these fluids would be particularly good for patients with hypocitraturia.", "p16": "Possible treatments:", "p17": "If you form calcium oxalate stones, it is important that you limit your intake of dietary oxalates. Many healthy foods contain oxalate, so rather than exclude these foods entirely, we ask that you limit those foods that are particularly high in oxalate. If you do consume foods high in oxalate, be sure to flush out the extra load of oxalate with an added glass or two of water.", "p18": "Oxalate and calcium bind together in the intestine and leave the body together in the stool. If there is not enough calcium, then the extra oxalate will have nothing in the intestine to bind to, so it will be absorbed into the bloodstream and end up in the urine, where it will form a calcium oxalate stone.", "p19": "No matter what your diagnosis, you should drink enough water to produce at least 2 liters of urine per day.", "p20": "Possible treatments:", "p21": "Most Americans far exceed the necessary protein intake, which can lead to too much uric acid in the urine. As a general recommendation, limit your daily protein intake to 12 ounces per day of beef, poultry, fish and pork. Twelve ounces is equivalent in size to about three decks of cards. This will be plenty of protein to meet your body’s needs.", "p22": "If you have tried a low-protein diet and you still have too much uric acid in your urine, your doctor may prescribe the drug allopurinol.

Similarly, stones that are associated with severe nausea or vomiting should be treated. Some stones are associated with infection or fever — such situations can be life threatening and demand prompt attention. Stones that are associated with a solitary kidney, poor overall kidney function or complete blockage of urine flow should also all be treated.", "p1": "Sometimes, when a stone is associated with bothersome symptoms, it may be appropriate to wait and see if the stone will pass on its own. If the stone is small, this is a very reasonable course of action. However, stones larger in size than 5 mm are unlikely to pass on their own and should be considered for treatment.", "p2": "There are some instances when it is OK to leave a kidney stone untreated. If the stone is small (less than 5 mm) and not causing any pain, there is a good chance that it will pass on its own after it falls into the ureter. Such stones may be followed with \"watchful waiting.\" This means that the stone is not actively treated, but instead your doctor keeps a check on the stone to be sure that it is not growing or changing. This can be done with periodic X-rays.", "p3": "Some kidney stones may be infected, and in many cases, despite proper antibiotic treatment, the infection cannot be cleared from the stone. In such cases, the only way to remove the infection completely is to remove the stone.", "p4": "These are extremely large stones that grow to fill the inside of the kidney. There are serious health risks associated with these stones, and left untreated they are associated with an increased risk of kidney failure.", "p5": "For example, the Federal Aviation Administration will not allow a pilot to fly until all stones have been cleared from his or her kidney.

That’s because a traditional stent graft has no openings to accommodate the branching of the aorta to the kidneys. In 2012, the FDA approved a fenestrated stent graft, now available in a few vascular surgery programs, including Johns Hopkins.

The aortic wall is made up of 3 layers of tissue. When a tear occurs in the innermost layer of the aortic wall, blood is then channeled into the wall of the aorta separating the layers of tissues. This generates a weakening in the aortic wall with a potential for rupture. Aortic dissection can be a life-threatening emergency. The most commonly reported symptom of an aortic dissection is sudden, severe, constant chest or upper back pain, sometimes described as \"ripping\" or \"tearing.\" The pain may move from one place to another.", "p1": "When a diagnosis of aortic dissection is confirmed, immediate surgery or stenting is usually done."}, "What causes aortic dissection?": {"p0": "The cause of aortic dissection is unclear.

Although most children recover naturally from stuttering, it’s not possible to work out who will get better on their own and who will need therapy. If a child stutters for some years, it can be harmful, even if natural recovery occurs without therapy.

This program is very effective and often stops children from stuttering altogether. The therapy can be provided at home and involves giving positive feedback when the child says something without stuttering. The child will need to see a speech pathologist every week. The Lidcombe Program is best for children under 6, although it can also be used for older children. ', 'Stuttering in adolescents and adults is usually treated using the Smooth Speech program. This program helps people practise and improve their communication skills. Smooth speech is often taught intensively over 1 week in individual or group sessions, with regular follow-ups with a speech pathologist.', 'Other programs include the McGuire program and the Ezy-Speech program. It is best to take advice from a speech pathologist about the best treatment for you or your child.', 'If your child or someone you know stutters, make time to listen to them and let them finish what they are saying.
